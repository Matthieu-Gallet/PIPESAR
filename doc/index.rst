Project References
------------------
- **Base Project**: `ML-WetSnowSAR <https://github.com/Matthieu-Gallet/ML-WetSnowSAR>`__
- **Thesis Project by**: Matthieu Gallet
- **Developped by**: Carlos Cortes and Matthieu Gallet
- **Enseignant charg√© du suivi du stagiaire** : Trouve Emmanuel

Introduction
------------
This framework is designed to facilitate the creation of pipelines for benchmarking various machine learning models in the detection of wet snow. It leverages different technologies for data management, job processing, and experiment management.

Key Features
------------
- **Experiment Management**: Utilizes `Qanat <https://ammarmian.github.io/qanat/>`_ for managing experiments locally or on dedicated servers.
- **Benchmarking**: Deploy multiple experiments with various ML models to obtain results on the same dataset, allowing easy benchmarking and comparison.
- **Customization**: Offers multiple options for selecting balancing methods, labeling methods, and more. Users can create diverse tests, comparing models with different data, seeds, and data selection methods.
